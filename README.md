# XGL S18 - Experimental Game Lab ARTTECH-4136-001

A homework repository for ARTTECH-4136-001-Spring-2018.

### Technology
**Used:** Unity, C#

### Commiting to GitHub

In order to submit just the codes files into GitHub, select a specific folder which you wish to commit:
```
git add <filename>
```
```
git commit -m "Comments"
```

If you are planning to update the commit, recommended way is to only stage the files which are modified:
```
git add -u
```
```
git commit -m "Comments"
```
**Disclaimer** - Once you've completed commiting to the repository, you need to make sure that you do not stage & commit any other unnecessary files to the repository.
